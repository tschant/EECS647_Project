KU EECS 647 Project
===============
This is a project that Blake, James and I did for EECS 647: Databases.
We created a basic game that utilizes a database to store player information, along with enemies, inventory, items, enemies drop items, and locations.

There are no sprites for player or enemies, yet. Most of the battle mechanics are there, like attack and magic.

The actual game is located [Here](http://blakehefley.com)
